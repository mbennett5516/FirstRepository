    <p id="intro">A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...</p>
    <p>I went to High School and explored a lot of different things that I may want to do with my life. 
        I was a trombone player in band, I was in drama, sang in my church choir, and excelled academically...</p>
    <p>None of that mattered. I still didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
    <p>Then a few years after graduating I decided to try something new and enrolled in DeVry University as a 
        Game and Simulation Programming student to learn how to make video games for a living. Unfortunately, 
        DeVry ended the program without allowing my class to graduate, leaving us with heavy debt and no marketable skills
        or a degree.</p>
    <p>A few years after re-joining the workforce doing just odd-jobs here and there, I decided that debt or no debt, I should
        go back into programming. What I <strong><em>did</em></strong> learn, I thouroughly enjoyed, so I looked for a place that would be affordable,
        and would teach me what I needed to know in order to make a living. I found the opportunity with SMU and TEK systems, and 
        the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
